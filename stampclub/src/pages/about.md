## Sacramento Philatelic Society

### **By Bill Oliver**

In 1914 Mr. A. W. Spanton placed an advertisement in the Sacramento Bee newspaper asking all interested in stamp collecting to meet for the purpose of forming a stamp club. Twelve responded with the result that the Sacramento Stamp Society was founded, and in 1961 was Incorporated as the Sacramento Philatelic Society.

The Sacramento Stamp Society held their meetings at the Y. M. C. A., but the membership grew rapidly and they moved to larger quarters at the Chamber of Commerce then to the Travelers Hotel where a meeting room was provided by the management.

Since that time the Sacramento Philatelic Society has held their meetings at churches, schools; and currently meeting at the Easter Seal Society Center, 3205 Hurley Way, Sacramento, CA every Wednesday evening with the doors opening at 7:00 PM, and the meeting at 8:00 PM. Currently there are over 250 members.

1941 saw the Council of Northern California Philatelic Societies hold their First Annual Exhibit at the Sacramento Hotel with the Sacramento Stamp Society as host.

The Sacramento Philatelic Society has held many stamp exhibitions, and in 1969 began their annual stamp exhibition SACAPEX (Sacramento Camellia City Philatelic Exhibition). This was a combined effort by the Sacramento Philatelic Society and the Camellia City Stamp Club of Sacramento for the first exhibition, but was produced solely by the Sacramento Philatelic Society the following years.

The name SACAPEX (Sacramento California Philatelic Exhibition) was continued and scheduled every two years until 1974 when it became an annual event.

The Sacramento Philatelic Society in 1957 started their Easter Seal Stamp Show as a communality project with all proceeds going to the Easter Seal Society. The first year began with a donation to the Easter Seal Society of $200.00 and the donations have increased every year to about $5,000.00 for the past twelve years, or more.

The Sacramento Philatelic Society celebrated their ninetieth anniversary in 2004 when the American Philatelic Society held their annual Champion of Champions exhibition at Sacramento.

The Sacramento Philatelic Society is an active club with many active members, and a number of activities by members for members. If you are in Sacramento on a Wednesday evening please come and say hello. Visitors are always welcome.
